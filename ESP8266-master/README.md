This repository is about some simple code, testing the ESP8266 board.

To start, I installed IDE Arduino 1.8.1, then, you only have to follow these steps:

Open preferences and insert http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json in "Additional Board Manager URLs".
Then, open Board Managers > Board menu and install esp8266.
The least step is select the ESP8266 after the installation in Tools > Board and select the right port in Tools > Port.

If you can't find the Port, it means that you have to find some drivers or you need to give some permitions.
